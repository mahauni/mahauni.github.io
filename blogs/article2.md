# HTOP VISUALIZATION TOOL

## memrvisualz tool made in go

The memrvisualz in my tool for visualization of htop utilizing Golang. I'm using bubbletea for the TUI.

I did this because using htop for my taste is not very intuitive, so for my own sake and to learn how to code in Go, I decided to do the project.

Right now, it only has few visualization parts, but is a WIP and I'm going to start working again when my university is done, and I'm back on track.
