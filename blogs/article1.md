## I love the terminal

Welp, what I can say, my whole coding experience is in the terminal after changing my OS to Fedora, and I use Vim btw, and because of that I don't even use a vscode to use another app instead of the terminal. so what now?

I'm using a classic setup, tmux and zsh for the terminal, and I'm using wezterm for the terminal emulator, but I'm not using anything particular from the wezterm, so I can use my setup in any terminal, the normal one, fish, ghostty or anyother.

For the multiplexer, I could use the wezterm one, but I prevered the tmux, because I can use in any other terminal, and is the one I'm more confortable at the moment. I could learn the wezterm one, and change the keybinds to the tmux, but in the end, I would be using tmux.

For the code editor, I use neovim, I use Vim btw, and because of that the terminal is the place is I go to.
